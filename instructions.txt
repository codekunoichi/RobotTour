we are programming vehicle for science olympiad robot tour. we need high precision yaw estimate, and our vehicle has gyroscope, magnetometer, accelerometer onboard. however, gyroscope may be enough considering we are only making turns and moving on differential drive base in 2 dimensional space. right now, we simply calibrate one time and add that bias to the reading from the gyrscop's yaw, and integrate change over a certain period of time and wrap to get an estimate fo ryaw in 360 degrees. our use case is operation of moving the robot forward, making precise 90 degree or 180 degree turns, in a 1-2 minute period. we need precision, but not perfection, right now we have 0.01 - 0.03 dps bias when stationary using this method. we also have that accelerometer (provides in g in x y z), magnetometer (x y z gauss), but their accuracy is similar to gyroscope and we want to try using only gyroscope and seeing what we can do beyond just simple integration. is it possible to get an angle estimate from the gyro data that's more accurate than what we have now, that won't drift so much, and how can we do it?
